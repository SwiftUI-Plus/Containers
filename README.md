# FittingGeometry

A geometry reader that automatically sizes its height to 'fit' its content.

## Example

```swift
FittingGeometryReader { geo in
    Text("The height is now \(geo.size.height)")
}
```

## Installation

The code is packaged as a framework. You can install manually (by copying the files in the `Sources` directory) or using Swift Package Manager (__preferred__)

To install using Swift Package Manager, add this to the `dependencies` section of your `Package.swift` file:

`.package(url: "https://github.com/SwiftUI-Plus/FittingGeometry.git", .upToNextMinor(from: "1.0.0"))`
